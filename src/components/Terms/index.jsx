				<h3>DISPUTES</h3>
				<p>
					ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO YOUR USE OF ANY OF THE
                    Sangria WILL BE RESOLVED BY BINDING ARBITRATION, RATHER THAN IN COURT, EXCEPT THAT YOU
                    MAY ASSERT CLAIMS IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT IF YOUR CLAIMS QUALIFY. THE FEDERAL
                    ARBITRATION ACT AND FEDERAL ARBITRATION LAW APPLY TO THESE TERMS OF SERVICE.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    THERE IS NO JUDGE OR JURY IN ARBITRATION, AND COURT REVIEW OF AN ARBITRATION AWARD IS
                    LIMITED. AN ARBITRATOR, HOWEVER, MAY AWARD ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS THE SAME DAMAGES
                    AND RELIEF AS A COURT (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY
                    RELIEF OR STATUTORY DAMAGES), AND MUST FOLLOW THESE TERMS OF SERVICE AS A COURT
                    WOULD. ARBITRATION IS MORE INFORMAL THAN A LAWSUIT IN COURT, AND ALLOWS FOR MORE
                    LIMITED DISCOVERY THAN IN COURT. THE ARBITRATOR WILL DECIDE ALL ISSUES, INCLUDING,
                    WITHOUT LIMITATION, ISSUES RELATING TO THE SCOPE AND ENFORCEABILITY OF THIS
                    ARBITRATION PROVISION.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    WE EACH AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN
                    INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. IF FOR ANY
                    REASON A CLAIM PROCEEDS IN COURT RATHER THAN IN ARBITRATION, WE EACH WAIVE ANY RIGHT
                    TO A JURY TRIAL.
