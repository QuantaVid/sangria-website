					This notice describes the Privacy Policy that applies to all information collected or submitted when
					you install or use the Sangria application or any of the other proprietary software applications or
					services we provide, and when you visit our website (all of which are referred to collectively
					herein
					as the "Sangria"). The Sangria is owned and operated by QuantaVid LLC. (referred to herein as "we,"
					"us," "our,", "Sangria"), which has developed applications and services for use in connection with a
					variety of devices and platforms.
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					We understand your concerns about privacy. We want you to understand what types of information
					we collect and what may happen to that information if you install the Sangria application, visit the
					Sangria Website or use any of the Sangria.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h3>USER ACCOUNTS AND COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>
					You are not required to create a user account or provide any personal information in order to visit
					the Sangria website. You are required to create a user account, however, to use our application.
					During registration, you are required to provide a name, password and valid email address.
					<br>
					<br>
					<br>
					If you choose to share any articles, videos, or other content with another person, we will ask you
					to
					provide a valid email address for that person. We may also ask you to provide your username and
					password for third party websites in order to access the articles and information published on such
					sites. We also collect information if you contact us for support or help, submit an application or
					otherwise communicate with us. The information which you supply to us enables us to customize
					and enhance the services we provide to you. In addition, it helps us communicate with you about
					our news, events, promotions and new products.
				</p>
				<h3>COLLECTION OF INFORMATION AS PART OF USING SANGRIA SERVICE</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to the information that you provide to us when you register for a user account, we
					collect
					information about the URLs, titles and content of the web pages and other information you save to
					Sangria. The types of information we collect includes your browser type, device type, time zone,
					language, and other information related to the manner in which you access the Sangria. We also
					collect information about your use of the Sangria so that we can provide our services
				</p>
				<h3>USE OF COOKIES AND ANALYTICS</h3>
				<p>
					In addition to the methods described above, we may also collect information using cookies or other
					technologies when you access our website or use Sangria. You may decline our cookies if your
					browser permits, although in that case you may not be able to use certain features, you may be
					required to enter your password more frequently during a session, and you may be unable to install
					or use certain Sangria. Cookies and other technologies make our Sangria easier to use and help us
					customize and personalize the services we provide based on your interests and activities.
				</p>
				<h3>USE OF INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>
					We use your personal information to respond to your requests and perform our contract with you.
					We may do this, for example, by using your contact information to respond to your inquiries, to
					provide customer support and to supply any products or services you have requested. In addition, if
					you choose to use the Sangria to share content with another person, we will use the recipient's
					email address or user account information to provide that service, but we will not use that email
					address for any other purpose.
				</p>
				<h3>SHARING OF INFORMATION</h3>
				<h4>Public Content</h4>
				<p>
					If you choose to make the content you save publicly available, we may share that information with
					others in accordance with the options you select. In addition, if you choose to use the Sangria to
					share articles, videos, or other content with another person, we will send an email on your behalf
					to
					that person with a link to the content that you have chosen to share.
				</p>
				<h3>Working with third parties</h3>
				<p>
					We may work with trusted third parties to facilitate one or more aspects of the products and
					services that we provide to you and to conduct research related to Internet usage, and we may
					provide some of your personal information directly to these third parties. For example, as discussed
					above, we may use a third-party payment processor to process payments for our paid subscription
					service. We may also share your device ID in working with third parties who assist us in delivering
					advertisements to you. These parties are subject to confidentiality agreements with us and other
					legal restrictions that prohibit their use of the information we provide to them for any other
					purpose
					other than those discussed above, unless you have explicitly agreed or given your prior permission
					to them for additional uses.

					<br>
					<br>
					Sharing as required by law or asset sale
					In the event that we or certain of our assets are acquired, user information may be included among
					the transferred assets.
					Although we strive to protect the personal information of our users, we will release personal
					information if required by law or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary. We follow
					the
					law whenever we receive requests about you from a government or related to a lawsuit. We will
					notify you when we are asked to hand over your personally identifiable information in this way
					unless we are legally prohibited from doing so. When we receive requests like this, we will only
					release your personally identifiable information if we have a good faith belief that disclosure is
					necessary or appropriate under applicable law. Nothing in this policy is intended to limit any legal
					defences or objections that you may have to a third party's request to disclose your information.
				</p>
				<h3>KEEPING INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>
					We will keep your information only for as long as we need it to provide you services, manage our
					business or as required by law or contract.
				</p>
				<h3>TRANSFER OF INFORMATION</h3>
				<p>
					We're a global organization and our computers are in several different places around the world. We
					also use service providers whose computers may also be in various countries. This means that your
					information might end up on one of those computers in another country, and that country may have
					a different level of data protection regulation than yours. By giving us information, you consent to
					this kind of transfer of your information. No matter what country your information is in, we comply
					with applicable law and will also abide by the commitments we make in this privacy policy.
				</p>
				<h3>SECURITY</h3>
				<p>
					We have agreements with third parties and have adopted other security measures in place to
					protect against the loss, misuse and/or unauthorized alteration of the information under our control
					or under the control of our service providers. Your personally identifiable information is protected
					by utilizing both online and offline security methods, including firewalls, passwords and restricted
					physical access to the places where your information is stored. Although we use industry standard
					practices to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal
					information or private communications will always remain free from security issues. In the event of
					a
					security breach involving your personal information, we will make any legally required disclosures
					to
					you in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay, consistent with the
					legitimate interests of law enforcement, or any measures necessary to determine the scope of the
					breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data system.
				</p>
				<h3>CHILD PROTECTION</h3>
				<p>
					We do not offer services to, or target, persons under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect
					personally identifiable information from children under 13. In compliance with the Children's Online
					Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), we will purge any information we receive from our database and
					cancel the corresponding accounts, if we discover that a child under 13 has provided us with
					personal information. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided
					us with personal information by email or otherwise, please contact us so that we will be able to do
					the necessary actions.
					<br>
					<br>
					Our product is intended for general use and has no restrictions on utilization by children. Sangria
					DOES NOT contain any hazardous, violent or any other content (e.g. augment reality) that may
					require parental supervision.
				</p>
				<h3>PHISHING</h3>
				<p>
					Identity theft and the practice currently known as "phishing" are of great concern to Sangria.
					Safeguarding information to help protect you from identity theft is a top priority. We do not and will
					not, at any time, request your username, password, credit card information or national identification
					number in an unsolicited e-mail or telephone communication. For more information about phishing,
					visit the Federal Trade Commission’s website.
				</p>
				<h3>AMENDMENTS TO POLICY</h3>
				<p>
					Please note this Privacy Policy will change from time to time. We may amend this Privacy Policy at
					any time by posting the amended terms on our Website that you can access at thesangriaapp.com
					or through the options or help menu of the Sangria application. All amended terms shall
					automatically be effective thirty (30) days after they are initially posted on the Website. If we make
					any material changes to our Privacy Policy that affect user information already stored in our
					database, we will post a prominent notice on our Website notifying users that our Privacy Policy has
					changed. Our use of your information shall be governed by the terms and conditions of our Privacy
					Policy in effect when you first use our application or thirty (30) after the terms are changed, as
					explained above.
				</p>
